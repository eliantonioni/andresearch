    Yes, I know Andre, last time I saw him tasting pleskavica in Belgrade. I can say that his leadership is not just about
    guiding us towards our goals but also about lighting the path with wisdom, empathy, and unwavering support.
    His ability to see potential in every challenge and opportunity in every obstacle inspires us to strive for
    excellence in our daily jobs. What about his current location, maybe it is <a href="#" onClick="myClick(10)">Russia</a>!
