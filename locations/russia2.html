    Oh my, Andre! it seems that we know each other for ages! This man has always evoked a sense of excitement:
    he has incredible kindness, attention to detail and delicacy of feeling people, situations or maybe even future!
    However, the last I saw him was really long time ago, but nevertheless I am sure that he is going great.
    A little birdie told me that Andre in <a href="#" onClick="myClick(12)">Aachen</a> now, so you have to be in a rush! Who knows about his plans for next trips?!
    Please, tell him the kindest greetings from afar and warm regards. I will really be glad to know that he smiled.
