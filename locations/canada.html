  <div class="padding-left-class"><p>Yes, I know him, even though I have never met him in Canada. However, I know for sure
  that Andre is a great manager who takes responsibility wisely. All his employees always give feedback only positively.
  No need to guess anything - please just look at his company, which is constantly growing. Working with Andre for more
  than two years has been a great experience for me personally.
  So, if you want to meet him, try to search in the <a href="#" onClick="myClick(1)">Philippines</a>.</p>
