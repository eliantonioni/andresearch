    Yes, I know Andre, but I think you won't find him in Kazakhstan now, as he could be anywhere in the world.
    He manages an international company and has many friends in different countries :). I know Andre as a high-class professional
    with a good sense of humor, and as is known, if IT specialists are laughing, it means things are going well.
    What's cool is that his motivational speeches can turn the phrase "Houston, we have a problem" into "It's just a trip to the Moon"...
    Try to catch him in <a href="#" onClick="myClick(4)">Armenia</a>, he is there more often, as far as I know.
