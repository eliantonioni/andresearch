    Are you looking for Andre?
    I know him. He is great man, very diligent, goal-oriented, successful businessman.
    By the way, when you find him, please convey my congratulations and wishes for strong health and success in business development!
    As for Andre in Ukraine… He was here several times, our country is beautiful and scenic, with nice people,
    but I haven't seen him for a long time. So, I guess, he could choose some other also beautiful country…
    Maybe it is <a href="#" onClick="myClick(9)">Serbia</a>!
