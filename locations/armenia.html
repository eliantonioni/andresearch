    Yes, I know Andre, last time we crossed paths in Yerevan long time ago. He was sampling lavash with a pomegranate juice in one hand
    and a duduk melody in the background. I even has a photo - look! What an uncredible day was!
    I can characterize him as Energetically Exhausting - Full of energy, dragging the team through marathons of brainstorming sessions,
    which feel like actual marathons, and Technologically Traditional - Loves the latest tech gadgets but still takes notes with a pen and paper.
    Rumor has it, he has now crossed over to <a href="#" onClick="myClick(5)">Georgia</a>, perhaps in pursuit of the perfect khachapuri. Who knows...
