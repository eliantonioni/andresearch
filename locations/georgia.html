    Yeah I saw Andre but only on the screen during the zoom meeting. Never meet him in Georgia actually.
    Also I know him under the name of **Master of Time Zones** who can seamlessly coordinate teams across continents.
    And **Strategy Sorcerer** who crafts visions and strategies that resonate across diverse cultures.
    So I believe you can reach him out somewhere where Europe meets Asia - in <a href="#" onClick="myClick(6)">Turkey</a>.
    Good luck chasing him
