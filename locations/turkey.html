    Yes, I met Andre 2 months ago and he seemed to be a really friendly, nice person to chat with.
    Even though we have never met with him in person in Turkey, I can characterize him as a strong leader,
    who is always trying to take care not only about the business, but also about the people he's working with.
    He's the kind of person that you always want to chat with regardless of the topics discussed, and in case of the
    work-related conversations - one can always get a piece of extremely useful feedback, because Andre is a broad-minded person.
    That being said, I heard that he was seen in <a href="#" onClick="myClick(7)">Montenegro</a>.
